## NPX Business Card

This is a fun method of connecting with me via terminal using npx. It leverages the **npm** ecosystem and **npx**'s ability to execute a CLI without installation. This project was inspired by [@jackboberg]( https://github.com/jackboberg ) and his article [Write a Simple npx Business Card ](https://studioelsa.se/blog/open-source-oss-npx-business-card/).

To use this, just run the following command

```
npx @seayjohnny/card
```

After that, you should see the following output in your terminal.
